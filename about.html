        <h1> When did Croissants appear? </h1>
        <p>The kipferl, the origin of croissant, can be dated back to at least the 13th century in Austria, and came in various
            shapes.The kipferl can be made plain or with nuts or other fillings (some consider the rugelach a form of
            kipferl).
        
            The birth of the croissant itself‚Äîthat is, its adaptation from the plainer form of kipferl, before the invention of
            viennoiseries‚Äîcan be dated to at least 1839 (some say 1838) when an Austrian artillery officer, August Zang, founded
            a
            Viennese bakery ("Boulangerie Viennoise") at 92, rue de Richelieu in Paris. This bakery, which served Viennese
            specialties including the kipferl and the Vienna loaf, quickly became popular and inspired French imitators (and the
            concept, if not the term, of viennoiserie, a 20th-century term for supposedly Vienna-style pastries). The French
            version
            of the kipferl was named for its crescent (croissant) shape and has become a universally identifiable shape across
            the
            world</p>
